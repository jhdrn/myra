Myra is (another) JSX rendering library. It is small, simple and built with and for [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Myra is a JSX rendering engine implementing a subset of React, but with some
differences (one being Myra uses requestAnimationFrame for updates).

## Implemented hooks
* useState - same as https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html
* useMemo - same as https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo
* useEffect - same as https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html
* useLayoutEffect - same as https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#uselayouteffect
* useRef - works similarly to Reacts implementation, but with a `.node` property
  which holds a reference to the component's DOM node (Myra does not support 
  the `ref` attribute). 
* useErrorHandler - Catches any errors and renders an "error view" instead of 
  the regular component view:
    ```JSX
        myra.useErrorHandler(error => <p>An error occured: {error}</p>) 
    ```
## Mounting a component
Use `myra.mount` to mount a component to the DOM:

```JSX
    // Mount the component to a DOM element
    myra.mount(<MyComponent />, document.body) 
```
## Memoized components
Use `myra.memo` to create a component that will only render if it's props have
changed. The second argument is an optional comparison function to make a custom 
rendering decision:

```JSX
    // Mount the component to a DOM element
    const MyMemoComponent = myra.memo<IProps>(props => <p></p>) 
```

## Special props
Some props and events has special behavior associated with them.

* The `key` prop should be used to ensure that the state of child 
components is retained when they are changing position in a list. When used with
elements, it may also prevent unnecessary re-rendering and thus increase performance.
_It's value must be unique amongst the items in the list._
* The `class` prop value will be set to the `className` property of the element.
